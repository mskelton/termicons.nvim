## Installation

Install with your favorite package manager (e.g. [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)).

```lua
{
  "mskelton/termicons.nvim"
}
```

## Setup

This plugin works alongside [nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons) and simply provides an alternative set of icons.

```lua
require("termicons").setup()
```

## Updating icons

The two main plugin files (`icons.lua` and `mappings.lua`) are auto-generated by `scripts/generate.lua`. As such, changes should be made to the generator and the associated files. If adding new icons, first add them to the [termicons](https://github.com/mskelton/termicons) project, then re-run `make generate` to pull in the new icons. To add additional file mappings or icon color overrides, update the associated tables in the `icons.lua` or `mappings.lua` file and run `make generate` to update the plugin files.
